Smart Contract for Voting System
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for a voting system. The smart contract provides the following functions and functionalities:

Functionality Overview

1. Candidate Registration ✅
   Candidates can register for the election by providing their information, such as name and address.
   Candidate details are stored in a data structure to track candidate information.

2. Voter Registration ✅
   Eligible voters can register by meeting specific criteria, such as age, citizenship, or residency.
   Registered voters are tracked to prevent duplicate registrations.

3. Voting Process ✅
   Voters can cast their votes securely and privately.
   Mechanisms are in place to prevent double voting and ensure each voter can only vote once.
   Voting data is stored securely and anonymously to maintain voter confidentiality.

4. Vote Counting ✅
   The smart contract includes a vote counting mechanism to tally votes for each candidate.
   Vote counts for individual candidates are updated as votes are cast.
   Total vote count and individual candidate vote counts are available for retrieval.

5. Election Results ✅
   Stakeholders can access the election results after the voting process is completed.
   Functions or events are available to emit winner(s) or provide a ranking of candidates based on vote counts.

6. Security and Access Control ✅
   Measures are implemented to ensure the security and integrity of the voting system.
   Access to critical functions and data is restricted to authorized participants only.
   Access control modifiers, such as onlyOwner or role-based access control, are used to manage permissions.

7. Event Logging ✅
   Events are emitted to log important actions or changes in the contract state, such as candidate registration, voter registration, and vote casting.
   Events provide transparency and serve as a source of information for external systems or applications.

8. Error Handling ✅
   Proper error handling mechanisms are implemented using custom error messages or revert statements to provide clear feedback to users in case of invalid or unauthorized actions.

9. Contract Initialization ✅
   The contract includes a constructor function to set initial parameters, such as the election name or duration.
   Contract setup or initialization tasks are performed within the constructor.

10. Testing and Deployment ✅
    Comprehensive unit tests are developed to ensure the correctness of the contract's functionality.
    The contract is deployed on a test network for testing purposes before being deployed on the main network.
    Please refer to the contract code for detailed implementation and usage instructions.
